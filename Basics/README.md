# 🧱 Basics & Logic Building

**Focus:** Foundational concepts to build a strong base for Data Structures & Algorithms.

## 📝 About
Before diving into complex data structures like Graphs or DP, it is crucial to master the syntax, logic building, and mathematical properties of programming. This directory covers the absolute essentials.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. ⏳ Time & Space Complexity
* Understanding Big O notation ($O(N)$, $O(\log N)$, etc.).
* Analyzing best, average, and worst-case scenarios.
* Space trade-offs (Auxiliary space vs. Flow space).

### 2. 🎨 Patterns (Logic Building)
* Mastering **Nested Loops**.
* Control flow and visualization.
* **[View Patterns Folder](./Patterns)** (Contains 22 standard problems).

### 3. ➗ Basic Mathematics
* **Number Theory:** Prime numbers, Armstrong numbers, GCD/LCM.
* **Digit Logic:** Extracting and reversing digits ($O(\log_{10}N)$).
* **[View Basic Maths Folder](./Basic_Maths)**.

### 4. 🔄 Recursion Basics
* Understanding the **Stack Space**.
* Base conditions vs. Recursive relations.
* Standard problems: Factorial, Fibonacci, Sum of N numbers.

### 5. 🗝️ Basic Hashing
* **Frequency Counting:** Using Arrays vs. HashMaps.
* Character hashing (ASCII mapping).
* Optimizing lookups from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$.
